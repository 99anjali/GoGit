There are some strict rules that you must know before contributing to this project.

- If you are making your first PR, then other than the task provided in the issue section, PR must contain your `info.md` file with some information about you
 at this location: <br>
  ```java
  CONTRIBUTORS / <Your college name> / <Current year of your UG course> / <Your name> / Info.md 
  (White spaces are only for your understanding). For reference you can see my info.md. 
  ```
  
- Strictly follow the templates provided inside `.github` directory to make your commits, PR and issues. (Unfollow may leads to PR rejection)
- Visit all the issue labels and read their descriptions carefully. These labels will be specified on the issues, and they will decide, who can claim which issue. <br> 
  Ex:- If label `only for beginners` is assigned to an issue, then it means it can only be done by the beginers with no or very less contribution over GitHub. I will also 
  suggest the pro devs to not to waste their time on these issues as they are not made for you üôè.
